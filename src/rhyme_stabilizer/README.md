# Stabilizer
Stabilizing the simulation box (viewport) based on given criterion.
In each step, the entire simulation box can move by one pixel in each direction.

## Out-of-place Build

- Create a `build` directory inside the module directory (skip this
  step if you already have made a `build` directory):

```bash
$ cd /path/to/the/root/directory/of/this/module
$ mkdir -p build
```

- Change the working directory into the `build` directory:

```bash
$ cd build
```

- Create a `Makefile` using `cmake` (if cmake is not install on
  your system, check this [link](https://cmake.org/install/)):

```bash
$ cmake ..
```

- To build the module, run `make` (if you want to see a more detailed
  message, you can set the `VERBOSE` variable):

```bash
$ make # or make VERBOSE=2
```

- To run module tests, run:

```bash
$ ctest --timeout 10 --output-on-failure
```

## Quick start

The fastest way to learn how to use this module is to check test cases
(which can be found inside `tests` directory).

## Roadmap

- [ ]
  - [ ] Adding 1 pixel border
  - [ ] Density-wighted average of distances
  - [ ] Reading relevant properties from the param file

# Theoretical Background

<!-- Relevant equations and algorithms -->

# Tests

Each source file has a matching test file which ideally contains
all relevant test cases. These test cases are the heart of our
code development and should be kept updated at all time.
